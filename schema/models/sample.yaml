  The sample metadata describes a sample taken from a donor and also describes any subsequent subsamples. For the initial sample, there will be a procedure_id value. For subsamples, the procedure_id will be empty and the supersample will be referenced by its sample_id in the field super_sample_id field. (We need input from the TMCs and IEC on how they will be tracking sample - subsample relationships.)  The sample_id and super_sample_id relationship can proceed down an arbitrary number of levels. Samples can be referenced to a landmark such as a fiduciary mark, to a clinically observable abnormality or the reference point (usually the [0,0,0] point) in a reference image. In the case of a reference image, fiduciary marks can be included in the image as well as coarser descriptions based on regions of the organ. For example; “capsule”, “cortex” or simply “upper” or “posterior”.
