  The procedure metadata describes the procedure or clinical visit that produced the sample from a donor identified as donor_id. A “procedure” produces a single “physical sample”. Note that a donor can have multiple procedures, due to either multiple samples taken in a single visit or samples taken during separate visits. The metadata for the donor can vary from procedure to procedure. For example, a donor can have samples taken on different dates and therefore have different donor ages associated with the different samples.
