  Image region metadata describes annotations of an image. An image may have multiple image region annotations and regions may overlap. Note that the image parameters of an overlay (e.g., height, width) must match the reference image. This is a one (image) to many (overlays) relationships. A particular overlay can contain multiple regions but all regions must have the same annotation. This data is intrinsically categorical, a region can only be yes/no.
