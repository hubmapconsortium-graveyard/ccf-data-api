  Image metadata describes the characteristics of a particular image. In some cases, we may have consecutive images/objects that have different scaling and/or offsets. For example, the mass spec data may have a resolution of several microns/pixels but be related to an adjacent section, imaged via birefringence, that has 0.5 micron/pixel resolution, and the MS data might have an x,y offset.

  # Special case of sequential images that have different scaling and/or offsets. This is for the particular case where an image set has both a standard microscopy image (e.g., a histology image) and an associated coarser grained image such as a mass spec data set. These fields provide the data needed to align and overlay the two images. The reference_image is assumed to be the correct scaling and this image must be scaled and/or translated to align it using the fields below. The scaling for this image (the one that needs scaling and/or offsetting) is defined in the normal image scale values (microscopy_resolution_[X,Y,Z]) listed above, which may be different from the microscopy_resolution value for the reference image. In most cases these fields will be empty. 
  reference_image:
    description: |
      UUID of a reference image that is logically related to this image.
    type: string

  image_channel_assignment_set:
    description: |-
      An image may have multiple channels (typically red, green and blue but other designations are possible). Often the channel represents a particular biological entity such as a stained protein in immunohistochem, or a nuclear stain. A color channel assignment differs from an “image region (overlay)” in that it contains continuous quantitative data instead of categorical data.

        channel_name:
          description: |
            Channel label in the image. Typically “red”, “green” or “blue” but other labels possible. May be integers.
